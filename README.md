# copyFilesPy
Copy files from source to destination only if date-time stamp is different

This is a utility that copy files from source to destination
(and creates the destination directory if does not exists)
only if the source date-time attributes are different than the destination,
otherwise if source and destination date-time is the same no files are copied.
Have fun !!
